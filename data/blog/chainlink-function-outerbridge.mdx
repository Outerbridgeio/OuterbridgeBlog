## What is Chainlink Function

Chainlink Functions provides your smart contracts with access to a trust-minimized compute infrastructure. Your smart contract sends your code to a Decentralized Oracle Network (DON), and each DON‚Äôs oracle runs the same code in a serverless environment.

The DON aggregates all the independent runs and returns the final result to your smart contract. Your code can be anything from simple computation to fetching data from API providers.

Read more on the [docs](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions) page. If you want to get more ideas, here's the [example functions](https://www.usechainlinkfunctions.com/) put together by the community.

## Why use Outerbridge

Chainlink Function has made developers life easier, allowing us to execute Javascript code from smart contract on-chain. However, there are some caveats:

- ‚ùå Hassle of reading 3rd party API docs to implement API calls
- ‚ùå Side effect on building non-idempotent requests, such as sending an email or storing data on the cloud. Since each oracle node runs the same computation in the Off-chain Reporting protocol, it will cause redundant requests such as sending multiple emails or storing the same data multiple times.

Outerbridge was able to solve this by using sticky `session-id`, everytime an execution is sent, each oracle node will receive the same `session-id`, allowing Outerbridge to detect if they are sent from the same request, hence preventing multiple redundant requests.
More technical implementation can be found from our official Github [repo](https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/Outerbridge/blob/master/packages/server/src/utils/index.ts#L803).

Outerbridge currently has 60+ integrations where users can just plug and play without having to code the entire API. Complex workflow involving multiple API providers can be easily built and configured.

- ‚úÖ Prevent multiple redundant calls
- ‚úÖ 60+ API integrations and growing
- ‚úÖ Ability to build complex workflows
- ‚úÖ Open source

In this post, we are going to take a look at how to trigger a workflow in Outerbridge by making a HTTP call using Chainlink Function.

**Let's get started üöÄüöÄüöÄ**

## Step 1: Building Workflow

Here's a simple workflow that is going to send a Discord message and return the message as a response upon completion.

The **GOAL** is to trigger this workflow using Chainlink Function.

<MyDynamicButton buttonText="Use Chainlink Workflow" copyTemplate="chainlink" />
<br />
<br />

1. **Chainlink Function Webhook**: Trigger workflow upon receiving the webhook call
2. **Discord**: Send discord message to channel. (_Replace with your channel's webhook URL_)
3. **NodeJS**: Return the message that was posted as final response

Click Deploy to activate the workflow.

## Step 2: Trigger workflow using Chainlink Function

We are going to use the **forked** [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) with Hardhat to set up on-chain contracts, test request, and send request to be fulfilled by the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracle Network (DON).

1. In a terminal, clone the **forked** [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) repository.

2. ```
   cd functions-hardhat-starter-kit/
   ```

3. Switch to correct branch:

   ```
   git checkout feature/Outerbridge-Webhook
   ```

4. ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Configure `.env` file:

   ```
   touch .env && open .env
   ```

   We are going to use Mumbai testnet:

   ```
   MUMBAI_RPC_URL="https://rpc.ankr.com/polygon_mumbai"
   PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>"
   ```

6. Compile the contracts in the repository:

   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

7. In `Functions-request-config.js` file, search for `messageToSend` and replace with whatever message that you like to post on Discord.

8. In `Functions-request-source.js` file line 10, replace `url: https://app.outerbridge.io/api/v1/webhook/7ylldwflap7630p` with your webhook URL.
   You can grab the webhook URL from Outerbridge:

   - Use the **Tunnel URL** when running Outerbridge locally:

   - Use the **Webhook URL** when using Cloud-hosted Outerbridge
     ![image](https://outerbridgepage.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-webhook.png)

9. Simulate the request:

   ```
   npx hardhat functions-simulate
   ```

   You should be able to see the message successfully posted on Discord channel.

10. Follow [guides](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/getting-started#configure-your-on-chain-resources) to configure on chain resources.

11. Finally, run the request. Specify your subscription ID with the `--subid` flag and specify your consumer contract address with the `--contract` flag:

    ```
    npx hardhat functions-request --subid YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --contract YOUR_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network mumbai
    ```

    If success, you should be able to see the following output:

    ```
    If all 100000 callback gas is used, this request is estimated to cost 0.200173241062964508 LINK
    Continue? (y) Yes / (n) No

üéâ That's it! You have successfully:

- ‚úÖ Built a workflow that send message to Discord, and return the message as final result back to your smart contract
- ‚úÖ Made a HTTP POST to webhook URL from Chainlink Function
- ‚úÖ Triggered the workflow
