## What is Outerbridge❓

[Outerbridge](https://www.outerbridge.io/) is an open source low code/no code workflow automation application, focusing on integrating both on-chain (**Web3**) and off-chain (**Web2**) applications.

Similar to Zapier, with drag and drop interface, users can easily build powerful workflows by connecting the application nodes.
For instance:

1. Upon receiving smart contract event
2. Send a Discord message to specific channel
3. Update Google Sheet
4. Execute a smart contract function

## Web3 vs Web2 🤔

**Web2** refers to the version of the internet most of us know today. Most of the applications we use daily such as Facebook, Google, Twitter are Web2 applications. These companies provide services/applications in exchange for your personal data.

**Web3** refers to decentralized applications that run on the blockchain. These applications allow anyone that is on the blockchain network to participate without monetising their personal data. Example of popular dapps are Peepeth (Twitter), Odysee (Youtube), Audius(Spotify), Brave (Google) and etc. As of now, there are over 3000+ dapps listed on dapp.com.

## Why build Outerbridge 🛠️

At work, our team were developing applications for clients on different blockchains. We find ourselves writing lots of custom scripts to interact between on-chain data and internal tools. Existing automation tools work great for Web2 apps, but nothing that suits our needs.

That's when we realized there is a need for a simpler tool. Hence we built Outerbridge with a simple goal:

**_Simplify Web3 Automation_**

Using:

- [x] Low/No code interface
- [x] API integrations to increase interoperability across Web3 and Web2

## Use cases 💡

Some of the use cases and tasks you can automate via Outerbridge:

- [x] Monitor smart contract events and functions (e.g: Transfer, Approve) and send notification via Discord, Teams, Slack or Email
- [x] Send notification to Discord server when NFT is minted/transferred
- [x] Notify user when a transaction does not gets through on-chain
- [x] Triggers automatic top-up if balance (e.g: BNB, ETH, Matic) dropped below certain threshold

## Open & Extensible 🙌

Outerbridge can be self-hosted and is easily extensible.
Project is written in TypeScript and React for frontend.
Developers with web experience can easily create custom apps integration in minutes.

## Getting Started 🚀

For developers that want to setup the project, here's the [QuickStart Guide](https://docs.outerbridge.io/get-started).

To know more on how to get started, here is a quick-start demo that covers the essential parts and features of Outerbridge.
