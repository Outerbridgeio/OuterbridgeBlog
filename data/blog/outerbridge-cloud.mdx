## Outerbridge Cloud

Outerbridge is an open source low code automation tool to connect Web3 and Web2 API without code.

We started out as a self-hosted open source project, since then users have been requesting to have a cloud hosted version. This opened up the doors to many non-technical users who would love to use Outerbridge to automate their workflows involving Web3 and Web2 applications.

For instance, sending Discord notification when ETH in wallet changes, triggers workflow when a new sales on NFT is detectedÂ , and so on.
