## How to create and reveal hidden NFTs

Using [ThirdWeb](https://www.thirdweb.com/), developers can easily create encrypted NFTs and schedule a time to reveal these hidden NFTs.
To achieve this, we are going to seperate the steps into 2 workflow templates:

- **Create Encrypted/Hidden NFTs**
- **Reveal NFTs**

### Create Encrypted/Hidden NFTs

![image](/static/images/reveal-nft-thirdweb/create-encrypted-nft.png)

import { useState } from 'react'
import { templates } from '@/data/template.js'

export const MyDynamicButton = ({buttonText, copyTemplate}) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const [copied, setCopied] = useState(false)

const onCopy = () => {
setCopied(true)
navigator.clipboard.writeText(JSON.stringify(templates[copyTemplate]))
setTimeout(() => {
setCopied(false)
}, 5000)
}

return <button style={{ height: 50 }}
className={`w-full rounded-md bg-primary-500 py-2 px-4 font-medium text-white hover:bg-primary-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary-600 focus:ring-offset-2 dark:ring-offset-black dark:hover:bg-primary-400 sm:py-0`} onClick={onCopy}>{copied ? 'Workflow Copied âœ…' : buttonText } </button>
}

<MyDynamicButton
  buttonText="Use Create Encrypted NFTs Workflow"
  copyTemplate="thirdweb-create-encrypted-nft"
/>

1.  Add 2 Thirdweb nodes onto canvas, or simply paste the copied workflow ðŸ‘†
2.  In the first node, we are going to create a batch of encrypted NFTs.

    Configure the first node as followed:

    - [x] **Action**: `Execute transactions on contracts`
    - [x] **Network**: Select network of the project
    - [x] **Input Parameters**:
          Navigate to ThirdWeb project, under the `Code` -> `Javascript` -> `Getting Started` section, you will see similar code as below:

           ```jsx
           import { ThirdwebSDK } from '@thirdweb-dev/sdk'

           const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK('<network>')
           const contract = await sdk.getContract('<Contract-Address>', '<Prebuilt-Type>')
           ```

           Back to ThirdWeb node on Outerbridge, fill in the parameters accordingly:

           - Contract Address: `<Contract-Address>`
           - Prebuilt Contract Type: `<Prebuilt-Type>`
           - Code: Copy paste the function you want to execute or query from ThirdWeb. For instance: **Delayed reveal**:
           ```jsx
           // the real NFTs, these will be encrypted until you reveal them
           const realNFTs = [{
             name: "Common NFT #1",
             description: "Common NFT, one of many.",
             image: "https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/micah/123.svg"
           }, {
             name: "Super Rare NFT #2",
             description: "You got a Super Rare NFT!",
             image: "https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/micah/456.svg"
           }];

           // A placeholder NFT that people will get immediately in their wallet, and will be converted to the real NFT at reveal time
           const placeholderNFT = {
             name: "Hidden NFT",
             description: "Will be revealed next week!"
           };

           // Create and encrypt the NFTs
           const tx = await contract.revealer.createDelayedRevealBatch(
             placeholderNFT,
             realNFTs,
             "mysecret",
           );

           return tx;
           ```

           - Wallet: Select wallet you'd like to sign the transaction on-chain, i.e creating the NFT batch

3.  For the second node, we are going to retrieve batches of hidden NFTs. The same steps apply with following changes:

    - [x] **Action**: `Read data from contracts`
    - [x] **Code**:
      ```jsx
      const batches = await contract.revealer.getBatchesToReveal()
      return batches
      ```

4.  Finally, we can start to execute the nodes. At the top right side, click the yellow lightning button âš¡

    A modal will pops up to allow you to select starting node, workflow will then be executed from the starting node till the end.

5.  After nodes have finished executing, you should see the hidden NFTs in ThirdWeb NFT dashboard.

### Reveal Encrypted/Hidden NFTs

<MyDynamicButton buttonText="Use Reveal NFTs Workflow" copyTemplate="thirdweb-reveal-nft" />

1.  Add 1 Scheduler node and ThirdWeb node onto canvas, or simply paste the copied workflow ðŸ‘†

2.  In the Scheduler node, configure the specific time you want to trigger the workflow

3.  In the ThirdWeb node, configure as below:

    - [x] **Action**: `Execute transactions on contracts`
    - [x] **Code**:
      ```jsx
      const batchId = 0 // the batch to reveal
      const tx = await contract.revealer.reveal(batchId, 'mysecret')
      return tx
      ```

4.  Workflow is now ready! Now save and deploy it. If you want to reveal NFT now, you can also click the `Test Node` button which will kicks off the reveal function immediately.

5.  Navigate to ThirdWeb dashboard, refresh the page and you should now see the hidden NFT has been revealed ðŸ¥³
