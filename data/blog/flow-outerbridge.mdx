## New chain supported - Flow

[Flow](https://flow.com/) is a proof of stake blockchain designed to be the foundation of Web3 and the open metaverse, supporting consumer-scale decentralized applications, NFTs, DeFi, DAOs, PFP projects, and more.

Developers and users on Flow can now build automation workflows such as monitoring balance changes, smart contract events, distributing rewards/payouts and etc.

## Monitoring Balance Changes

Here's a simple workflow example that will monitor FLOW token from user wallet, and send Discord message whenever a change is detected.

1. **Flow Balance Trigger Node**: Monitor FLOW token from wallet for every 15 secs
2. **Discord Node**: Send discord message to channel whenever someone transfer FLOW token to the wallet

ðŸŽ‰ That's it! Copy the workflow and try it out at [Outerbridge](https://app.outerbridge.io)!
