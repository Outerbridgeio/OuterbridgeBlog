## Footprint Analytics X Outerbridge

[Footprint Analytics](https://www.footprint.network/) provides API and visualization tools to uncover and visualize data across the blockchain, including NFT and GameFi data.
Outerbridge is proud to announce partnership with Footprint Analytics ðŸ’ª
With integration of powerful and data-rich SQL/Data API from Footprint Analytics, users are now able to perform automation tasks with little to no coding required.

### Monitor Compound Finance Transactions

One of the most common use cases is monitoring blockchain data and alert users if red flags/dangerous signals are detected.
Below is an example workflow used to schedule a 24 hours timer to monitor [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/) transactions, and send Discord message if transaction amount is over certain threshold.

1. **Scheduler Node**: Once the workflow is deployed, every 24 hours, the workflow will be started
2. **Footprint Analytics Node**: Get Compound Finance transactions data
3. **NodeJS Node**: Filter transactions with amount > 20
4. **Discord Node**: For each filtered transaction with amount > 20, send a tailored message to Discord channel

ðŸŽ‰ Voila! You now have a fully-automated workflow that will send you messages on Discord whenever transactions with amount > 20 are detected on Compound Finance.
