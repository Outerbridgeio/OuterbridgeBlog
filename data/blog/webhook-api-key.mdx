## Webhook API Key ðŸ”‘

A webhook is an HTTP request, triggered by an event in a source system and sent to a destination system. Let's say if you have built a workflow on Outerbridge and you would like the workflow to start executing once a HTTP call is made, Webhook node is what you're looking for.

However, anyone can call the Webhook URL and trigger the workflow, and this might cause some privacy and security issues.

The solution to that is to specify an API Key that is needed to be included in the headers of the Webhook URL as `X-API-KEY`, and only execute the workflow if the API key matches.

Below shows the video of how it can be used on Outerbridge:

<div className="flex">
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="450"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KPS4_t8K1Bg"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
