## How to listen for Webhook

In this example, we are going to create a workflow that will gets triggerred whenever a new event is emitted from smart contract through [Moralis Stream](https://moralis.io/streams/), and post a message to Discord channel.

## What is Moralis?

[Moralis](https://moralis.io/) provides world-class APIs to developers across the globe, allowing companies and projects of all sizes to seamlessly integrate blockchain into their solutions stack and scale with ease.

[Moralis Stream](https://moralis.io/streams/) is a feature that stream blockchain data into your backend via webhooks.

## Workflow Configuration

The workflow template can be copy paste onto Outerbridge canvas, but there are some input parameters that need to be configured.

### Discord node

- Change the Webhook URL to the channel you would like to post the message. Official guide from Discord: [Making a Webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)

## Test Workflow

Navigate to the block explorer page of the contract you just deployed, connect to your wallet, and execute the function.
In this case, the deployed smart contract has a function named `newDonation`, let's enter a value and write the transaction.
