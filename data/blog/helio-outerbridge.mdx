## Helio X Outerbridge

[Helio](https://www.hel.io/) is a complete Web3 payments platform that makes it easy for merchants and creators to accept crypto payments for e-commerce, NFT sales, subscription payments, token-swapped payments, content paywalls, and more.

Helio offers powerful APIs and Webhooks that allow developers to build custom automation and UI/UX. With Helio integration on Outerbridge, users can build automation workflow without coding.

One such use cases would be listen to successful payment, update Google Sheet and send a Slack/Discord notification.

### Update GSheet and add contacts to CRM upon successful Helio payment

Below is an example workflow that listen to successful payment made via Helio, update GoogleSheet, add the user to Mailchimp and Hubspot contact list.
This allows businesses to keep track of the updated transactions and contacts for follow up emails, campaigns and feedback.
